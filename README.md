Using APIs to track weather trends

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to use APIs to generate possible vacation destinations based on desired minimum and maximum temperature preferences. By generating random latitudes and longitudes, we were able to use APIs with OpenWeatherMap and Google Maps to pull weather data and plot city locations all over the world. After finding ideal vacation destinations from these locations based on their average temperature, we used Google Maps to load directions between four of them to plan our upcoming trip.
